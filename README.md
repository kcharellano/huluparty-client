## General info
The client part of HuluParty is a chrome extension that allows users to create and join watch parties on [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com).

The HuluParty extension only works when a user is on a Hulu movie/video. You'll know when HuluParty is active when the icon becomes bright green.

### Creating A Session
To create a session, click on the icon and click on the *Create Session* button. This will generate a link in the textbox below the button that you can copy and share with other users. Its also recommended to pause the video when you create a session to make sure everyone who joins syncs up correctly. 

### Joining A Session
To join an existing session copy and paste a shared link into your chrome browser. This will take you to the correct video. Then click on the HuluParty icon, paste the link inside the textbox below the join button, the click the join button.

Clicking the join button will prompt the HuluParty server to sync your video player with other users in the session.
